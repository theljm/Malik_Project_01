# Malik_Project_01

This is my repository, Malik_Project_01.

Background: For this project, I decided to begin with creating a Word document file, Background_IQLead.docx, which is within the Background subdirectory.

Code: Then I created my Rmarkdown file and for safety measures, I decided to have an output both in Word and pdf methods.

DataProcessed: For part 3, when I needed to create the new dataset with the correction, I decided to put my modified dataset (with the 999 -> 99 correction) in that subdirectory.

DataRaw: This is where I decided to put the lead-iq.csv dataset.

Reports: Since we needed to push two reports, one without the correction and one with the correction, I input both HW reports in this folder and it is evident with the specific commits.
